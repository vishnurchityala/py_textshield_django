# py_textshield_django
PyTextShield is a free online text encryption tool that uses the powerful Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode. Constructed as a Django based web application, PyTextShield features an adaptable toolbox that contains two tools: a decryptor and an encryptor. Using the AES algorithm in ECB mode, the encryptor encrypts data securely by accepting plain text and a secret key as input. On the other hand, the decryptor goes in the other direction, using the ciphertext and a key as input to carefully decode (decrypt) the data. PyTextShield is a dependable option for protecting sensitive data because it uses AES, which adds an additional degree of protection.

## Objectives

• To use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to construct an interactive web application or website tool.

• Using Django to administer and operate a webpage built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

• To become familiar with and put Django concepts into practice in order to enable PyTextShield to function and encrypt and decode data.

## Project Outcomes

PyTextShield successfully encrypts and decrypts the data by taking input from the toolbox of the webpage.

This project gave a kick start to learn Django framework for web-development.
