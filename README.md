# py_textshield_django
PyTextShield is a free online text encryption tool that uses the powerful Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode. Constructed as a Django based web application, PyTextShield features an adaptable toolbox that contains two tools: a decryptor and an encryptor. Using the AES algorithm in ECB mode, the encryptor encrypts data securely by accepting plain text and a secret key as input. On the other hand, the decryptor goes in the other direction, using the ciphertext and a key as input to carefully decode (decrypt) the data. PyTextShield is a dependable option for protecting sensitive data because it uses AES, which adds an additional degree of protection.

##Objectives

• To use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to construct an interactive web application or website tool.

• Using Django to administer and operate a webpage built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

• To become familiar with and put Django concepts into practice in order to enable PyTextShield to function and encrypt and decode data.

##Project Outcomes

PyTextShield successfully encrypts and decrypts the data by taking input from the webpage and toolbox of the webpage. Project has been tried and tested on the developmental server of the computer it is programmed on.

The webpage runs smoothly without any errors. It encrypts and decrypts the data, if any error is found in form submission it displays a message to the user about the error that has occurred.
